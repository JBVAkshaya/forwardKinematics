# Installation

IMPORTANT: The package is dependent on a modified version of urdf2casadi that allows to
pass symbolic values to the forward kinematics. This modification is implemented in the
fork https://github.com/maxspahn/urdf2casadi.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -e .
```
